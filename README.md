# Bank-Account

## Description  
Bank-Account is a simple, object-oriented banking system simulation. It demonstrates core OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts — such as classes and objects — while allowing you to: create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and track transaction history. This makes it a great project for learning how to model real-world systems in code using OOP principles.

## Why This Project?  
- **Learn OOP fundamentals** — understand how classes define blueprints (e.g. account attributes and behaviors), and how objects (instances) represent individual accounts.  
- **Practice with basic banking logic** — manage account balances, enforce balance checks, and maintain a record of transactions.  
- **Simple, extendable foundation** — easy to build upon if you want to add more features (e.g. interest calculation, persistent storage, multi-account management).

## Features  

- Create multiple bank-account instances (objects), each with its own owner, balance, and history  
- Deposit funds into accounts  
- Withdraw funds (with balance validation)  
- Maintain per-account transaction history (deposits, withdrawals)
